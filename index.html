      <p> CodeNationGroup Studios powering Discord Server Management Solutions </p>
      <p> Since Early 2019, our creator (CodeNationGroup) has been designing applications in discord, websites with HTML/CSS/JS and doing much more.
Then, we decided to take a different approch and start designing applications with the purpose of managing servers in discord. </p>

      <p> CodeNationGroup currently is operating a handful of experimental applications. This is due to low funds and no hosting providers. All applications in our beta phase are fully operational with the exception of reliable hosting and a few errors here and there. Also due to discord limitations all of our applications have a maximum of 100 servers for the time being (shards). We will open donations soon and those who donate will be guarenteed to receive their product. </p>
      <p> We do however, have a few applications successfully running in <a href="/invite"> invites </a> </p>
